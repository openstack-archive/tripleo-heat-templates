      # This network is shared by the overcloud deployment and a Neutron
      # provider network that is set up post-deployment for consumers like Nova
      # VMs to use to mount shares. The allocation pool specified here is used
      # for the overcloud deployment for interfaces on the ControllerStorageNfs
      # role nodes and for the VIP where the Ganesha service itself is exposed.
      # With a default three-controller node deployment, only four IPs are
      # actually needed for this allocation pool.
      # When you adapt this file for your own deployment you can of course
      # adjust the allocation pool -- just make sure to leave a good-sized range
      # outside the allocation pool specified here for use in the allocation pool
      # for the overcloud Neutron StorageNFS provider network's subnet definition.
