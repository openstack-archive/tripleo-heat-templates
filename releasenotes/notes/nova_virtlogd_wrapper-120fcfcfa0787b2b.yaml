    When nova_virtlogd container gets restarted the instance console auth files
    will not be reopened again by virtlogd. As a result either instances need
    to be restarted or live migrated to a different compute node to get new
    console logs messages logged again.
    Usually on receipt of SIGUSR1, virtlogd will re-exec() its binary, while
    maintaining all current logs and clients. This allows for live upgrades of
    the virtlogd service on non containerized environments where updates just
    by doing an RPM update.
    To reduce the likelihood in a containerized environment virtlogd should
    only be restarted on manual request, or on compute node reboot. It should
    not be restarted on a minor update without migration off instances.
    This introduces a nova_virtlogd_wrapper container and virtlogd wrapper
    script, to only restart virtlogd on either manual or compute node restart.
