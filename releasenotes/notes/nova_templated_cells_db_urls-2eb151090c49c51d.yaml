    Nova now allows use of templated urls in the database and mq
    connections which will allow static configuration elements to be
    applied to the urls read from the database per-node. This should
    be a simpler and less obscure method of configuring things like
    the per-node bind_address necessary for director's HA arrangement.
    This patch addresses the templated DB urls as part 1.
