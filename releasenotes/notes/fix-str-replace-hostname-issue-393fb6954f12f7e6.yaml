    Fixes an issue where Custom Hostnames is in use. Previously it was possible
    that the ``HostnameMap`` lookup lookup would return unexpected and
    incorrect results if the hostname (the key) is not in the map. The string
    replacement mechanism used previously was replaced by a yaql expression
    that will do exact matching only. If no matching key is in the
    HostnameMap, the default hostname is returned.
