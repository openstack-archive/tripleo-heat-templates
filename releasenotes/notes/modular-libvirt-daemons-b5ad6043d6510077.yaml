    This change adds functionality to enable modular libvirt daemons.
    All these daemons runs in its respective container. Also the default
    configuration is to use modular libvirt daemons instead of monolithic libvirt
    daemon.
    Here is the list of libvirt daemon which are added in this change.
    - virtnodedevd
    - virtproxyd
    - virtqemud
    - virtsecretd
    - virtstoraged

    It's possible to define the individual log filters for each one of these daemon
    using the following new parameters:
    - ``LibvirtVirtlogdLogFilters``
    - ``LibvirtVirtsecretdLogFilters``
    - ``LibvirtVirtnodedevdLogFilters``
    - ``LibvirtVirtstoragedLogFilters``
    - ``LibvirtVirtqemudLogFilters``
    - ``LibvirtVirtproxydLogFilters``

    More information regarding modular libvirt daemons is available here.
    `Libvirt Daemons <https://libvirt.org/daemons.html>` _.
deprecations:
  - |
    This change deprecates the nova-libvirt-container-puppet.yaml heat-template
    which configures monolithic modular libvirt daemon.
    The newly added heat-template for modular libvirt daemons will be used to
    configure libvirt services in different containers.
