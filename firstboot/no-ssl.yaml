  This is a default no-op template which can be passed to the
  OS::Nova::Server resources. This defines the parameters that
  need to be passed in order to have SSL enabled in the controller
  nodes. This template can be replaced with a different
  implementation via the resource registry, such that deployers
  may customize their first-boot configuration.
