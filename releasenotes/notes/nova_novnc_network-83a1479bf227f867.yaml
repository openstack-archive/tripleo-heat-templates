    Nova vnc configuration right now uses NovaVncProxyNetwork, NovaLibvirtNetwork
    and NovaApiNetwork to configure the different components (novnc proxy,
    nova-compute and libvirt) for vnc. If one of the networks get changed from
    internal_api, the service configuration between libvirt, nova-compute and
    novnc proxy gets inconsistent and the console is broken.
    This changed to just use NovaLibvirtNetwork for configuring the vnc endpoints
    and removes NovaVncProxyNetwork completely.
