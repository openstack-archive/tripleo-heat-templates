    A heat parameter ``IronicPowerStateChangeTimeout`` has been added which sets
    the number of seconds to wait for power operations to complete, i.e., so
    that a baremetal node is in the desired power state. If timed out, the power
    operation is considered a failure. The default is 60 seconds, which is the
    same as the current Ironic default.
