    Fixes an issue where gateway ping validations performed during deployment
    would fail. When setting the `ManageNetworks` parameter to `false` and no
    gateway was configured, the list of gateway IP addresses to ping would
    include empty strings for networks with no gateway. The validation would
    attempt to run a ping command without the address to ping, which caused the
    deployment to fail. See bug:
