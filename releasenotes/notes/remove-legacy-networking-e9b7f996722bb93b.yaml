upgrade:
  - |
    The template files to manage network resources(eg. ports) by heat have been
    all removed. All network resources should be pre-created by
    the separate network privisioning process.

  - |
    The ``ManageNetwork`` parameter has been removed. This parameter had no
    effect when network resources are pre-deployed by the network provisioning
    process.
