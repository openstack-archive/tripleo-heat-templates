    The libvirt driver has added support for hardware-offloaded OVS
    with vDPA (vhost Data Path Acceleration) type interfaces.
    vDPA allows virtio net interfaces to be presented to the guest while
    the datapath can be offloaded to a software or hardware implementation.
    This enables high performance networking with the portablity of standard
    virtio interfaces.

    Nova added support for vhost-vdpa devices in Wallaby.
