    Add IronicDefaultBootInterface parameter to allow users to set / override
    the default boot interface used by ironic. This may not work if a hardware
    type does not support the set boot interface. This overrides create-time
    defaults.  The ordered union of the enabled boot interfaces and hardware
    type determines, under normal circumstances, what the default will be.
