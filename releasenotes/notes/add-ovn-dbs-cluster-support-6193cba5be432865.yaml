features:
  - |
    Added OVN DBs clustering support. In this service model, a clustered
    database runs across multiple hosts in multi-active mode.
upgrade:
  - |
    Upgrades from OVN non-HA and OVN DBs pacemaker to OVN DBs clustered are
    currently not supported.
security:
  - |
    The OVN database servers in an OVN DBs clustering and TLS-everywhere
    deployment will listen on all IP addresses (0.0.0.0). This is a caveat that
    can only be addressed once RHBZ 1952038 is fixed.
