    "podman image prune" is no longer used on the undercloud to remove unused
    images during the undercloud update/upgrade. With the usage of ephemeral
    Heat, not all images will always be used by running or stopped containers,
    so "podman image prune" should not be used to clean up the local container
    image storage. Images that are no longer being used can still be removed
    individually with "podman rmi".
