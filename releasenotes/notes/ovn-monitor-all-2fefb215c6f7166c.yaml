    With conditional monitoring enabled in OVN, southbound ovsdb-serve
    takes lot of time in handling the monitoring and sending the updates
    to all its connected clients. Its takes lot of CPU. With monitor-all
    option, all ovn-controllers do not enable conditional monitoring there
    by reducing the load on the Southbound ovsdb-server.
