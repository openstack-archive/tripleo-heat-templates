# title: Nova Compute Cell Stack
# description: |
#   Environment file for deploying additional compute cell
#   in a separate stack (multi-stack) deployment.
parameter_defaults:
  # Whether this is an cell additional to the default cell.
  # Type: boolean
  NovaAdditionalCell: True

  # Indicates that the nova-metadata API service has been deployed per-cell, so that we can have better performance and data isolation in a multi-cell deployment. Users should consider the use of this configuration depending on how neutron is setup. If networks span cells, you might need to run nova-metadata API service globally. If your networks are segmented along cell boundaries, then you can run nova-metadata API service per cell. When running nova-metadata API service per cell, you should also configure each Neutron metadata-agent to point to the corresponding nova-metadata API service.
  # Type: boolean
  NovaLocalMetadataPerCell: True
