    Adds a new parameter ``NeutronMetadataWorkers`` for OVN. This
    parameters allows users to configure the number of OVN metadata
    workers separately from the value of ``NeutronWorkers``. The OVN
    metadata workers are deployed onto the compute nodes and not on the
    controllers/gateways as the OVS ones.
