    On the compute nodes, right now ssl certificates got created for
    libvirt, qemu-default, qemu-vnc and qemu-nbd. This is not required
    because the all services use the same NovaLibvirtNetwork network and
    therefore multiple certificates for the same hostname get created.
    Also from qemu point of view, if default_tls_x509_cert_dir and
    default_tls_x509_verify parameters get set for all certificates, there
    is no need to specify any of the other `*_tls*` config options. From
    `Secure live migration with QEMU-native TLS <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/secure-live-migration-with-qemu-native-tls.html>`_

    The intention (of libvirt) is that you can just use the
    default_tls_x509_* config attributes so that you donâ€™t need to set any
    other `*_tls*` parameters, unless you need different certificates for
    some services. The rationale for that is that some services (e.g.
    migration / NBD) are only exposed to internal infrastructure; while
    some sevices (VNC, Spice) might be exposed publically, so might need
    different certificates. For OpenStack this does not matter, though,
    we will stick with the defaults.

    Therefore with this change InternalTLSNbdCAFile, InternalTLSVncCAFile
    and InternalTLSQemuCAFile get removed (which defaulted to
    /etc/ipa/ca.crt anyways) and just use InternalTLSCAFile.

    Also all cerfificates get created when EnableInternalTLS is true to
    and mount all SSL certificates from the host. This is to prevent
    certificate information is not available in a qemu's process container
    environment if features get switched later, which has shown to be
    problematic.
