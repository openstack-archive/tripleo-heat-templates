    RHEL-8.3 kernel disabled the Intel TSX (Transactional
    Synchronization Extensions) feature by default as a preemptive
    security measure, but it breaks live migration from RHEL-7.9
    (or even RHEL-8.1 or RHEL-8.2) to RHEL-8.3.

    Operators are expected to explicitly define the TSX flag in
    their KernelArgs for the compute role to prevent live-migration
    issues during the upgrade or update process.

    We now introduce this validation in tripleoclient to ensure
    early failure.

    The `ForceNoTsx` flag will disable this validation on a per-role
    basis.
