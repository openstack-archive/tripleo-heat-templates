  # Setting NeutronEnableDVR enables distributed routing support in the

  NeutronL3AgentMode: 'dvr_snat'

  # Enabling DVR deploys additional services to the compute nodes that through
  # normal operation will consume memory. The amount required is roughly
  # proportional to the number of Neutron routers that will be scheduled to
  # that host. It is necessary to reserve memory on the compute nodes to avoid
  # memory issues when creating instances that are connected to routed
  # networks. The current expected consumption is 50 MB per router in addition
  # to the base reserved amount.  Deployers should refer to existing
  # documentation, release notes, etc. for additional information on estimating
  # an appropriate value. The provided value here is based on an estimate of 10
  # routers and is an example value *only* and should be reviewed and modified
  # if necessary before deploying.
  NovaReservedHostMemory: 2560

  # Required if deploying with the ComputeDVR role, which is recommended
  # if using the default network templates as it will configure the
  # host networking to work with the default 'datacentre' network.
