    Enable image copy for multiple RBD Glance stores

    Previously when using multiple RBD glance stores the operator was responsible for copying the image to all stores.
    Nova-compute now has the ability to automatically copy an image to the local glance store when required.
    This change enables the feature and adds the following role specific
    parameters to control the behaviour.

    -  ``NovaGlanceRbdCopyPollInterval``
    -  ``NovaGlanceRbdCopyTimeout``
