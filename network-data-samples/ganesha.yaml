      # This network is shared by the overcloud deployment and a Neutron
      # provider network that is set up post-deployment for consumers like Nova
      # VMs to use to mount shares. The allocation pool specified here is used
      # for the overcloud deployment for interfaces on the ControllerStorageNfs
      # role nodes and for the VIP where the Ganesha service itself is exposed.
      # With a default three-controller node deployment, only four IPs are
      # actually needed for this allocation pool.
      # When you adapt this file for your own deployment you can of course
      # change the /20 CIDR and adjust the allocation pool -- just make sure to
      # leave a good-sized range outside the allocation pool specified here for
      # use in the allocation pool for the overcloud Neutron StorageNFS
      # provider network's subnet definition.
