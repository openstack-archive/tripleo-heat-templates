    `QemuDefaultTLSVerify` will allow operators to enable or disable TLS client
    certificate verification. Enabling this option will reject any client
    who does not have a certificate signed by the CA in
    /etc/pki/qemu/ca-cert.pem.
    The default is true and matches libvirt's. We will want to disable this
    by default in train.
