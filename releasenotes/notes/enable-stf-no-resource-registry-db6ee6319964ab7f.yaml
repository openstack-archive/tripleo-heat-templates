  handled via existing templates.

    When upgrading a deployment with the use of enable-stf.yaml, add the
    following files to your overcloud deployment command in order to maintain
    the existing services defined in enable-stf.yaml.

      - environments/metrics/collectd-write-qdr.yaml
      - environments/metrics/ceilometer-write-qdr.yaml
      - environments/metrics/qdr-edge-only.yaml

    Using enable-stf.yaml now defines the expected configuration in OpenStack
    for use with Service Telemetry Framework. Removal of the defined
    resource_registry now requires passing additional environment files to
    enable the preferred data collectors and transport architecture, providing
    better flexibility to support additional architectures in the future.
