        # With the layered product packaging, the key package is rhosp-openvswitch. It depends on
        # a openvswitch package that includes the version as part of the name (e.g openvswitch2.10).
        # This requires some additional special handling:
        #   - During an upgrade the package name for openvswitch may change so
        #     upgrading the currently installed package won't do anything.
        #   - The rhosp-openvswitch package "obsoletes" several packages,
        #     including older openvswitch packages. This results in a pretty
        #     severe uninstall/install sequence of operations that stops and
        #     removes openvswitch which could break network links required to
        #     continue the upgrade.
        #   - To prevent rhosp-openvswitch breaking connectivity, the currently
        #     installed core openvswitch packages need to be erased from the rpm
        #     database but leave the binaries intact. This effectively
        #     short-circuits the obsoletes mechanism in rhosp-openvswitch and
        #     leaves the core elements of openvswitch running. In the future we
        #     may replace this mechanism with "an upgrade on reboot".  We only
        #     do this for the core openvswitch packages so other packages
        #     obsoleted by rhosp-openvswitch will be removed when
        #     rhosp-openvswitch is installed/upgraded.
        #   - Neither the rhosp-openvswitch nor openvswitch{m.n} package enables
        #     or starts the systemd service so there must always be a task
        #     to ensure that it is enabled or OpenvSwitch functionality won't be
        #     available on reboot.
        #   - With LP, we expect that the core openvswitch package name will
        #     change with every major upgrade so this special handling will
        #     eventually replace the special handling of upgrading the
        #     openvswitch package "in place"
