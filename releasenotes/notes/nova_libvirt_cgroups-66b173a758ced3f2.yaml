upgrade:
  - |
    To re-enable the QEMU driver features lost after the previous minor update,
    such as `virsh cpu-stats`, or volume attachements for existing Nova Compute
    instances, those need to be live-migrated (or cold-migrated) to either of
    the newly updated Nova Compute hosts.
fixes:
  - |
    Tripleo Nova Libvirt service unit no longer manages the QEMU driver cgroups
    by systemd, but delagates that to libvirt. In a result, newly created Nova
    Compute instances no longer experience problems with volume attachements,
    or executing virsh commands in the libvirt podman container, after the
    libvirt service restarts multiple times.
