features:
  - |
    The ``OS::TripleO::{{role.name}}::PreNetworkConfig`` resource has been
    restored. This resource can be used to implement any configuration steps
    executed before network configurations are applied.

fixes:
  - |
    Now ``ExtraConfigPre`` resource and ``NodeExtraConfig`` resource are
    executed after network configurations are applied in nodes. This is
    consitent with the previous version with heat software deployment
    mechanism instead of config-download.
