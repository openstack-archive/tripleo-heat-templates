features:
  - |
    Introduce new parameters {{role.name}}NetworkConfigUpdate.
    This will be a bool. When {{role.name}}NetworkConfigUpdate is True
    existing network configurations will be updated. By default, this 
    is False and only new deployments will have the networks configured. 
    This parameter is role based only, with no global option.
deprecations:
  - |
    This change removes NetworkDeploymentActions and
    {{role.name}}NetworkDeploymentActions.
    Since we can no longer rely on the Heat stack action when using
    Ephemeral Heat in tripleo.
