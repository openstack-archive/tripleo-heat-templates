  Environment file collectd-write-qdr.yaml no longer specifies a default
  CollectdAmqpInstances hash.
upgrade:
  - |
    When upgrading an environment that uses collectd-write-qdr.yaml the
    CollectdAmqpInstances defaults previously specified need to be added to an
    administrator provided environment file and used during the overcloud
    deploy process.
fixes:
  - |
    The collectd-write-qdr.yaml no longer specifies a default
    CollectdAmqpInstances hash. When specified, it was not possible to override
    the parameter, resulting in a combined hash of the default values and the
    administrators custom values which could lead to unexpected issues.
