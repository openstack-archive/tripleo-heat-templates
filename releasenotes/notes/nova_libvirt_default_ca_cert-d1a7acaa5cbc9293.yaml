    InternalTLSNbdCAFile, InternalTLSVncCAFile and InternalTLSQemuCAFile
    do not point to the default IPA ca.crt file and instead are requested
    to be loaded to component specific CA files (even if they are the same).
    This can lead to a race where the CA cert is not being written by
    certmonger in time.
    Ib868465c20d97c62cbcb214bfc62d949bd6efc62 already changed the default to
    use the IPA system cacert file '/etc/ipa/ca.crt' per default starting with
    the wallaby release using the ansible role. This change backports to also
    use the IPA system cacert file '/etc/ipa/ca.crt' to previous release when
    managing the certs via puppet-tripleo.
