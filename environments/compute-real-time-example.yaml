# A Heat environment that can be used to deploy a real-time compute node
# Deploying a real-time compute node requires enabling hugepages for the
# overcloud nodes, which is done by default for the ComputeRealTime role.
# However, the CPU pinnings (IsolCpusList and NovaComputeCpuDedicatedSet)
# need to be set in an environment file like this, according to the hardware
# used for the real-time compute nodes.
# Also the hugepages parameters in KernelArgs should be set accordingly
# the memory of the real-time compute nodes.
# It's also possible to overwrite the default values for other parameters like
# TunedProfileName and ComputeRealTimeImage here.
