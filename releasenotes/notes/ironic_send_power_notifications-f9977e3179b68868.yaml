    Added paramter ``IronicEnableNovaPowerNotifications`` (defaults to:
    ``true``). The parameter controls the ``[nova]/send_power_notifications``
    option in ironic.conf which is used to enable/disable the power state
    change callbacks to nova.
fixes:
  - |
    The undercloud now disables ``[nova]/send_power_notifications`` in the
    ironic service. This fixes an issue where ironic-conductor on the
    undercloud would try to report power state changes to nova and fail
    because nova service is not runnint on the undercloud. See bug:
    `2000308 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/2000308>`_.
