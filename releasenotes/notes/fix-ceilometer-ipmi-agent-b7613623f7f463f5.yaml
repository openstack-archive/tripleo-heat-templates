    Upon including "environments/metrics/ceilometer-write-qdr.yaml"
    to the deploy command, "CeilometerAgentIpmi" service does not start.
    If enabled, this service is supposed to run on individual compute
    nodes to gather IPMI sensor data using "hardware.*" pollster.
    Update every Compute role file where "CeilometerAgentIpmi" service
    was found missing. 

    Add "--logfile" parameter to the ceilometer-polling command to log
    the process output to "ipmi.log" file.

    Ipmi agent must run inside a privileged container which is
    required to execute ipmitool commands on the host and gather
    power metrics. Without privileges oslo.privsep.daemon reports
    "OSError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted".
