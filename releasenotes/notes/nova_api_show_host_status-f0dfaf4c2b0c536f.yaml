    Add `NovaShowHostStatus` to allow overriding API policies to access the compute
    host status in the requested Nova server details. The default value 'hidden'
    allows only admins to access it. Setting it to 'all' ('unknown-only') without
    additional fine-grained tuning of `NovaApiHostStatusPolicy` shows the full
    (limited) `host_status` to the system/project readers.

    Add `NovaApiHostStatusPolicy` that defines a custom API policy for
    `os_compute_api:servers:show:host_status and
    `os_compute_api:servers:show:host_status:unknown-only`.
    These rules, or roles, replace the admins-only policies based on the given
    `NovaShowHostStatus`: 'unknown-only' shows the limited host status UNKNOWN
    whenever a heartbeat was not received within the configured threshold, and
    'all' also reveals UP, DOWN, or MAINTENANCE statuses in the Nova server
    details. Finally, `NovaShowHostStatus`: 'hidden' puts it back being visible
    only for admins. Additional policies specified using `NovaApiPolicies` get
    merged with this policy.
