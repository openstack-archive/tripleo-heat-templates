    Add parameter `NovaLiveMigrationWaitForVIFPlug` which allows to set
    `live_migration_wait_for_vif_plug` which in turn allows whether to
    wait for ``network-vif-plugged`` events before starting guest transfer.
    The default value for the parameter is set to true and it is set
    to false when `ovn` is in `NeutronMechanismDrivers` list.
