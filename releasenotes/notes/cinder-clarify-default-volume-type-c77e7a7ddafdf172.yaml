    Steps are taken to minimize chances of confusion between the default
    block storage volume type established by the CinderDefaultVolumeType
    parameter, and cinder's own __DEFAULT__ volume type.

    In a new deployment where no volumes exist, cinder's __DEFAULT__ type is
    deleted because it is redundant. In an upgrade scenerio, if volumes exist
    then the __DEFAULT__ type's description is updated to indicate the actual
    default volume type is the one established by the CinderDefaultVolumeType
    parameter.
