    For Nova computes that need to keep running EL8, you can replace
    ``OS::TripleO::Services::NovaLibvirt`` service with
    ``OS::TripleO::Services::NovaLibvirtLegacy`` in its role files to run the
    monolithic libvirt. Unlike the modular deamons consumable with EL9
    computes, that legacy service should only be used for Train to Wallaby
    skip-level (fast-forward) upgrades, and should not be used in new
    deployments.
