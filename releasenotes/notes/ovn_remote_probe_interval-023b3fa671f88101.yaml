    This parameter sets inactive probe interval of the JSON session
    from ovn-controller to the OVN SB database. By default this it
    is 5s which not be sufficient in loaded systems or during high
    control-plane activity spikes, leading to unnecessary reconnections
    to OVSDB server. Now it is extended by default to 1 min and it is
    configurable by param OVNRemoteProbeInterval.
