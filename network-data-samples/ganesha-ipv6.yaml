      # This network is shared by the overcloud deployment and a Neutron

      # VMs to use to mount shares. The allocation pool specified here is used

      # role nodes and for the VIP where the Ganesha service itself is exposed.

      # actually needed for this allocation pool.

      # adjust the allocation pool -- just make sure to leave a good-sized range
      # outside the allocation pool specified here for use in the allocation pool
      # for the overcloud Neutron StorageNFS provider network's subnet definition.
