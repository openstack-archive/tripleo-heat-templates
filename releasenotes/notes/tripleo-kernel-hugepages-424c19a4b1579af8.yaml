    Adding Hugepages role parameter

    Hugepages management was always a manual step done by operators via the
    TripleO parameter ``KernelArgs``. This is error prone and causing confusion.

    The new ``Hugepages`` parameter allow operators to define hugepages as
    dictionnary, making it easier to read and follow.

    To prevent unvolontary changes, there's multiple validations before
    applying a change:

      - We convert the current running configurations to an actual dictionnary
        that we validate the new format against
      - If no change is necessary, even though the format might not be the same,
        there's no kernel_args update.
      - By default, we don't remove hugepages in places except when operators
        specifically set the ``ReconfigureHugepages`` to true.

    This change is also opening the door to more automations and automatic
    tuning.
