# title: Distributed Compute Node with storage
# description: |
#   Environment file for deploying a remote site of distributed compute
#   nodes (DCN) in a separate stack (multi-stack) deployment with storage;
#   either HCI or with separate storage nodes. It should be used in
#   combination with environments/cephadm/cephadm.yaml.
parameter_defaults:
  # When running Cinder A/A, whether to connect to Etcd via the local IP for the Etcd network. If set to true, the ip on the local node will be used. If set to false, the VIP on the Etcd network will be used instead. Defaults to false.
  # Type: boolean
  CinderEtcdLocalConnect: True

  # The Cinder service's storage availability zone.
  # Type: string
  CinderStorageAvailabilityZone: dcn

  # The cluster name used for deploying the cinder-volume service in an active-active (A/A) configuration. This configuration requires the Cinder backend drivers support A/A, and the cinder-volume service not be managed by pacemaker. If these criteria are not met then the cluster name must be left blank.
  # Type: string
  CinderVolumeCluster: dcn

  # List of enabled Image Import Methods. Valid values in the list are 'glance-direct', 'web-download', or 'copy-image'
  # Type: comma_delimited_list
  GlanceEnabledImportMethods: web-download,copy-image

  # The availability zone where new Nova compute nodes will be added. If the zone does not already exist, it will be created. If left unset, it will default to the value of the stack name.
  # Type: string
  NovaComputeAvailabilityZone: ''

  # Whether instances can attach cinder volumes from a different availability zone.
  # Type: boolean
  NovaCrossAZAttach: False

  # Refuse to boot an instance if it would require downloading from glance and uploading to ceph instead of a COW clone.
  # Type: boolean
  NovaDisableImageDownloadToRbd: True
