    Add posibilities to configure ovn dbs monitor interval
    in tht by OVNDBSPacemakerMonitorInterval (default 30s).
    Under load, this can create extra stress and since the
    timeout has already been bumped, it makes sense to bump
    this interval to a higher value as a trade off
    between detecting a failure and stressing the service.
