    When deploying a new HA overcloud, the mysql/galera service can now be
    configured to use mariabackup for State Snapshot Transfers (SST) by
    configuring the new Heat parameter `MysqlGaleraSSTMethod`. Mariabackup
    SST uses a dedicated SQL user with the appropriate grants to transfer
    the database content across nodes. The user credentials can be
    configured via two additional Heat parameters `MysqlMariabackupUser`
    and `MysqlMariabackupPassword`.

    The new support for mariabackup SST for the mysql/galera service is
    currently limited to new overcloud deployments. Doing a stack update
    to change SST method from rsync to mariabackup or the other way around
    is currently not supported.
