    The tripleo-heat-templates parameter DnsServers has been deprecated.

    The dns_nameservers from the ctlplane subnets has been used by default for
    overcloud node nameservers for a long time, see:
    https://review.opendev.org/579582.

    Since Wallaby network configuration is applied prior to the Heat stack
    create, during overcloud node provisioning. In this case the THT parameter
    DnsServers is not available when network configuration is applied.
    Effectively the DnsServers parameter cannot be used in Wallaby and later
    releases.
