    The default ovsdb-server deployment mode has been switched from
    active/backup with Pacemaker to the native active/active RAFT clustering.
issues:
  - |
    To operate well at scale, it is important that OVS 2.17+ is used when
    deploying with RAFT clustering. Specifically, python-ovs >= 2.17.1 is
    required.
upgrade:
  - |
    When upgrading from a non-RAFT deployment, the old Pacemaker ovn-dbs-bundle
    containers will still exist and need to be cleaned up. They will not
    interfere with the function of the cluster, as all services connecting to
    ovsdb-server will be configured to connect to the server's individual IP
    addresses and not the Pacemaker ovsdb-server VIP.
