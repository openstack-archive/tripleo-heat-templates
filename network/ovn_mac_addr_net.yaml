      Manage the network and related resources (subnets and segments) with
      either create, update, or delete operations (depending on the stack
      operation). Does not apply to ports which will always be managed as
      needed. Defaults to true. For multi-stack use cases where the network
      related resources have already been managed by a separate stack, this
      parameter can be set to false.
