    ## Attempting to deploy DPDK without appropriate values for the below parameters may lead to unstable deployments
    ## due to CPU contention of DPDK PMD threads.
    ## It is highly recommended to to enable isolcpus (via KernelArgs) on compute overcloud nodes and set the following parameters:
    #OvsDpdkSocketMemory: ""       # Sets the amount of hugepage memory to assign per NUMA node.
                                   # It is recommended to use the socket closest to the PCIe slot used for the
                                   # desired DPDK NIC.  Format should be comma separated per socket string such as:
                                   # "<socket 0 mem MB>,<socket 1 mem MB>", for example: "1024,0".
    #OvsPmdCoreList: ""            # List or range of CPU cores for PMD threads to be pinned to.  Note, NIC

                                   # desired number of PMD threads can all play a role in configuring this setting.
