  - A new service, OS::TripleO::Services::UndercloudUpgradeEphemeralHeat is
    added to the Undercloud role. The service is mapped to OS::Heat::None by
    default, but when environments/lifecycle/undercloud-upgrade-prepare.yaml is
    included, the service will be enabled and will migrate any already deployed
    stacks in the undercloud's Heat instance to be able to be used with the
    ephemeral Heat deployment option from tripleoclient.
