    Two instances of the glance-api service are now deployed per the
    recommendations outlined in `OSSN-0090 <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0090>`_.
    The user facing service does not provide access to image location data,
    whereas a new internal glance-api service provides location data to
    administrators and services that need it (e.g. cinder and nova), and is
    accessible via the admin and internal keystone endpoints.
upgrade:
  - |    
    A new OS::TripleO::Services::GlanceApiInternal service is introduced to
    handle deploying the internal instance of the glance-api service. When
    upgrading an overcloud deployed with a custom roles file, the new
    GlanceApiInternal service must be added to every role that includes the
    GlanceApi service. Roles that include the GlanceApiEdge service should not
    include the new GlanceApiInternal service.

    Deployment of the new internal glance-api service is generally transparent,
    and includes updating glance's endpoints in the keystone catalog.
    In a Distributed Compute Node (DCN) deployment, the control plane and
    all DCN sites need to be updated in order to fully deploy the new internal
    glance-api service.
deprecations:
  - |
    The GlanceShowMultipleLocations parameter is deprecated.
