# title: Monolithic Controller Non-HA deployment
# description: |
#   A Heat environment that can be used to deploy controller and compute
#   services in an Non-HA configuration with SSL undercloud only and a
#   flat network.
#   This should be used with a roles_data.yaml containing the Controller,
#   Compute and CephStorage roles.
#   openstack overcloud roles generate -o ~/roles_data.yaml Controller Compute CephStorage
parameter_defaults:
  # Number of CephStorage nodes to deploy
  # Type: number
  CephStorageCount: 1

  # Format for CephStorage node hostnames Note %index% is translated into the index of the node, e.g 0/1/2 etc and %stackname% is replaced with the stack name e.g overcloud
  # Type: string
  CephStorageHostnameFormat: '%stackname%-cephstorage-%index%'

  # Number of Compute nodes to deploy
  # Type: number
  ComputeCount: 1

  # Format for Compute node hostnames Note %index% is translated into the index of the node, e.g 0/1/2 etc and %stackname% is replaced with the stack name e.g overcloud
  # Type: string

  # DNS servers to use for the Overcloud (2 max for some implementations). If not set the nameservers configured in the ctlplane subnet(s) on the undercloud will be used.
