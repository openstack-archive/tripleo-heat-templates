    The neutron agent report interval was recently changed from the 30s
    default to 300s. This caused issues whith timeouts when providing
    baremetal nodes. A new parameter IronicNeutronAgentReportInterval
    has been added with a default of 30s so that the report interval
    specifically for the networking baremetal agent is restored.
