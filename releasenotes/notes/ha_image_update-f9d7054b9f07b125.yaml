    For HA services managed by pacemaker, it is now possible during a minor
    update to change Heat parameters `ClusterCommonTag` or `ClusterFullTag`
    to reconfigure the intermediate container image name used internally by
    pacemaker. This is achieved by running external_update_tasks with tag
    `ha_image_update`. A new pre-check ensures that when changing those
    Heat parameters, the external update tasks must have run prior to the
    regular update tasks.
